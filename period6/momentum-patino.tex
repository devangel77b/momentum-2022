\begin{abstract}
\student{The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy neither created or destroyed, it can only change form. Kinetic energy ($KE=\frac{1}{2} m v^2$) is the energy an object has because of its motion. It  is essential in the movement of objects and the understanding of elastic collisions. We determined whether the law is true during an elastic collision using an instrumental, one-dimensional cart system.  Our conclusion was that kinetic energy is indeed conserved.}

\section{Introduction}
\cite{ortega-2021-momentum} and others established that linear momentum ($p=m\vec{v}$) is conserved during inelastic collisions. Momentum reflects that the ``hitting power'' of an object involves both its mass and its velocity; here we consider one-dimensional (1D) collisions and will drop the vector notation for simplicity.  

On the other hand, kinetic energy for a point mass is given by:
\begin{equation}
\text{kinetic energy}\ E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2,
\label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is mass in \si{\kilo\gram} and $\vec{v}$ is the velocity in \si{\meter\per\second} \cite{duchatelet-1741-reponse, coriolis-1829-calcul}. Energy reflects the potential to do work, and can be traded among many different forms. 

While simple linear momentum conservation was sufficient to predict velocity during inelastic collisions, energy could potentially allow us to understand the differences between  inelastic collisions, elastic collisions (the bodies bounce off one another), and explosions (when two stationary bodies shoot off in different directions). If energy is conserved during such collisions, it could be a powerful and useful tool in understanding.

Therefore, we wish to answer the question, is energy conserved during an elastic collision? We consider the total kinetic energy of the two-body system before ($E_0$) and after ($E_f$) the collision as
\begin{align}
E_0 &= \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1,0}^2\ \text{before collision}\\
E_f &= \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1,f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2,f}^2\ \text{after collision}.
\end{align}
We hypothesize that energy is conserved during such collisions:
\begin{equation}
H_0: E_f = E_0\ \text{(energy is conserved)}.
\end{equation}
Alternatively, energy could somehow increase during a collision; or it could decrease owing to friction or other loss mechanisms bleeding energy from the system: 
\begin{align}
H_1: E_f &> E_0\ \text{(energy increases)} \\
H_2: E_f &< E_0\ \text{(energy decreases)} .
\end{align}

We tested these hypotheses by conducting a large number of two-body elastic collisions with known masses and observing the velocities before and after the collision. For each collision, we found the total system $E_0$ and $E_f$ to determine whether energy is conserved or not. 

\section{Methods and materials}
\subsection{Elastic collision tests}
Elastic collision tests ($n=80$) were conducted using a \SI{2.1}{\meter} aluminum momentum test track (Vernier; Beaverton, OR; see \fref{fig:methods1}). The test track was outfitted with two small wheeled carts (mass of cart \SI{0.3}{\kilo\gram}) with simple sliding contact bearings; mass of each cart could be increased by addition of up to four \SI{0.125}{\kilo\gram} masses for a total mass of \SI{0.8}{\kilo\gram}. The mass was measured using an electronic balance (Ohaus; Parsippany, NJ).    Magnets of opposite polarity allowed the carts to stick after the inelastic collision. Carts were actuated by hand to provide initial velocities. The position of the two carts was measured using two ultrasound range sensors (Go Direct; Vernier; Beaverton, OR). Sensor data were logged at \SI{20}{\hertz} sampling frequency, via a wireless Bluetooth link, using the Graphical Analysis app (Vernier; Beaverton, OR) running on an iPad Air (Apple; Cupertino, CA). From the position data, the slope of position versus time was used to estimate velocities before and after the collision.  The mass, velocity, and direction down the track were varied haphazardly.

 \subsection{Energy calculations}
 Calculations were performed using both Graphical Analysis and Sheets (Google; Mountain View, CA). 
 Energy before the collision was calculated as
 \begin{equation}
E_0 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1,0}^2
 \end{equation}
Similarly, the final energy was calculated as
 \begin{equation}
E_f = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1,f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2,f}^2
 \end{equation}
and the difference in energy as 
 \begin{equation}
\Delta E =  E_f - E_0. 
 \end{equation}
For a nondimensional comparison, we also computed the ratio of the change of energy to the initial energy ($\hat{\pi}=\frac{\Delta E}{E_0}$). Additional plots and $t$-tests were done using R \cite{r-2021} and the \lstinline{tidyverse} library \cite{wickham-2019-welcome}. 

\section{Results}
\Fref{fig:results1} shows the position data for a typical elastic collision with equal masses, $m_1=m_2=\qty{0.3}{\kilo\gram}$. Before the collision, $m_2$ is stationary while $m_1$ approaches with velocity $v_1=\qty{0.3}{\meter\per\second}$. The masses collide at $t=\qty{2.1}{\second}$. After the collision, $m_1$ is stopped, while $m_2$ is moving with a velocity $v_{2,f}=\qty{0.3}{\meter\per\second}$.

After the collision, $m_2$ is moving with velocity $v_{2,f}=\qty{0.3}{\meter\per\second}$. }

\Fref{fig:results2} shows a bar plot of the change in energy during all collisions, $\Delta E = \qty{-0.01\pm0.02}{\joule}$ (mean$\pm$s.d.). The mean $\Delta E$ is not significantly different from \qty{0}{\joule} (one-sample $t$-test, n=80, d.f.=79, p=0.2596).

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Is kinetic energy conserved?}
\student{Kinetic energy is conserved. The data collection over three different periods is shown. The data shows that the change in energy was close to 0. The average of the energy that we got was \qty{-0.01\pm0.02}{\joule}. Through our experiments, we were able to conclude that our results were accurate due to the different tests run. The different test runs were one of the ways that we lessened the possibility for experimental error by changing the weight, people, and force. However, this does not mean that there was no chance for experimental error.}

\subsection{Experimental Error}
\student{Our experiments came with the possibility of errors. With our limited resources we were not able to experiment if the same would apply to larger scaled experiments. In addition there could have been errors with our sensors and our online application system. These systems proved to be faulty, however our conclusion still makes sense and therefore there could have been cause for errors.}
